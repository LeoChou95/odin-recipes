    <h1>Instant Steel Cut Oats Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/oats.webp" alt="A picture of instant pot oats">
    <p>Steel cut oats are incredibly easy to make in the Instant Pot. Using the sauté function to toast the oats in olive oil before adding liquid for pressure cooking adds a nice toasty flavor. This recipe is for traditional steel cut oats, not quick cooking-cook ones. Once cooked and cooled, put oats in an airtight container and refrigerate. In the morning, take about a half cup and add 1/4 cup water or milk, then steam for 15 minutes with your Instant Pot's steam function. Stir well and enjoy oats every morning during the week!</p>

    <h2>Prep & Cooking Time</h2>
      <p>5 minutes prep and 30 minutes cook time</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons of virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups of steel cut oats</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon</li>
        <li>6 cups of water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Set a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) to the sauté function and press start. Heat olive oil in the cooker for 1 minute. Add oats, and cook and stir until toasted, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add nutmeg and cinnamon, stir well, then stir in water and vanilla extract. Turn off the sauté function.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer’s instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. </li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer’s instructions, 10 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Unlock and remove the lid, then stir the oatmeal vigorously, making sure to incorporate the oats at the bottom of the pot where they will be thicker. Scoop out about 1/2 cup of oatmeal and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
