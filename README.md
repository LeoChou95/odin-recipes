odin-recipies v1.0

This is my first project where I make a recipe website using html only.

After completing this project, I will be able to:
1. Create a repository on Github
2. Clone the repository to my local workspace
3. Find and open the repository on the local machine
4. Stage, commit (with a good message), and push to Github using Git

What will the webpage include:
1. A home pag with relative links to different recipies
2. images of the food
3. Use ordered lists and unordered lists
